# Excursion
**Excursion Project**

This is a quick project to practice HTML and CSS for **codecademy**'s Full Stack Web Developer program.

We practiced:
* writing HTML
* writing CSS
* using git and github
* using the command line
* using code editing software (in this case Visual Studio Code - and some Vim at the beginning)
* (and editing MarkDown with this **readme.md**)
